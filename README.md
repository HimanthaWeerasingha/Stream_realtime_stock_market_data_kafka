# Stock Market Data Ingestion with AWS, Kafka & RDS

# Project Description

This is a real-time data ingestion and storage pipeline for stock market information, built on AWS. This project simulates realtime generated dummy stock market data and streams it through an Apache Kafka server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The Kafka cluster processes the incoming data in real time and forwards it to an AWS RDS database for persistent storage and querying.
